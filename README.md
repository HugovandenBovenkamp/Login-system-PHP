<h1>Login system with PHP</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a project I intend to create to learn object oriented programming with PHP.</p>

<h3>This application requires the following:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The user can Register and create an account </li>
    <li>The user can Login with their already created user account </li>
    <li>If a user forgets their password, they can create a new password and replace it with their current one. <br>(password recovery)</li>
    <li>The application uses PDO for connecting to the database and SQL injection.</li>
    <li>The application is made using the MVC design pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
    <li>What are constructors and how can I use them effectively in this project</li>
    <li>What are controllers? Is this something I can use this project?</li>
    <li>How does PDO work in comparison to mysqli(what I am comfortable using)?</li>
    <li>How do I create a database without using XAMPP and what files do I need to create?</li>
    <li>In what situations do I need to use private and protected functions?</li>
</ul>
