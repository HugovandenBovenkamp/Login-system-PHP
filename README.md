<h1>Login system with PHP</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a project I intend to create to learn object oriented programming with PHP.</p>

<h3>This application requires the following:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The user can Register and create an account </li>
    <li>The user can Login with their already created user account </li>
    <li>The user can Log out of the application</li>
    <li>If a user forgets their password, they can create a new password and replace it with their current one. <br>(password recovery)</li>
    <li>The application uses PDO for connecting to the database and SQL injection.</li>
    <li>The application is made using the MVC design pattern.</li>
    <li>Have a error 404 page that shows up when something is wrong</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
    <li>What are constructors and how can I use them effectively in this project</li>
    <li>What are controllers? Is this something I can use this project?</li>
    <li>How does PDO work in comparison to mysqli (what I am comfortable using)?</li>
    <li>How do I create a database without using XAMPP and what files do I need to create?</li>
    <li>In what situations do I need to use private and protected functions?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues I encountered and Diary: </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>The first issue I encountered was making a good folder structure that contains the MVC structure. After a google search I started creating the correct folders like Models, Views and Controllers. What I noticed was that it is necessary to put the index.php and functions.php in the root.</li>
    <li>My second issue / thought was : "Where do I start?". I started making an index.php file and began making two forms and worked up from there. Making the proper controller files and view pages.</li>
    <li>My third issue was regarding routing, I never did this before, so I spend a good amount of time googling and reading about routing. I started to realize that routing is probably a good idea to put in the "index.php" file. The login and register controllers are instantiated in the index file.</li>

</ul>
